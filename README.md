# Maze walkthrough

This tiny game allows you to walk through a 2-dimensional maze with a 3-dimensional first-person view. That is, the viewpoint moves through the open areas of the maze.

The maze is read from [a sample maze text file](/eclipse-project/sample_maze.txt). Upon hitting the spacebar, you can either switch between [third-person view and top view](#screenshots).

(It's written with JOGL, the Java Binding for the OpenGL API, and written for my Computer Graphics cource.)

## Screenshots
