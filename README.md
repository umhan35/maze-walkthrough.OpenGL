# Maze walkthrough

This tiny game allows you to walk through a 2-dimensional maze with a 3-dimensional first-person view. That is, the viewpoint moves through the open areas of the maze.

The maze is read from a sample maze text file. Upon hitting the spacebar, you can either switch between third-person view and top view.
